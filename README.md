# My personal website
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b04db425-31d9-41ae-956c-fdec691aa0fb/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/youssefsafi/deploys)

A personal website built with [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) and hosted free of charge as a static website on [netifly](https://www.netlify.com) with the help of [flask-frozen](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/).

Why using all these frameworks and not just using a static web page? Well I am willing to add personal data science projects and hoping I can let users test them on my website in the future.

Right now it contains a simple landing page and a link to my resume. Future projects will be shared and published on the website.
